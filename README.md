This is the Java Assignment. I have implemented the ManageStaff Class and its CRUD operations.

The program will help the admin staff at Yummy Pizza to create roster for their staff. They can add members, assign them a shift with date and time and edit the same. I have used OOP concepts and performed the CRUD operations.
1)ManageYummyPizzaStaff folder has the Java code implementation. I have used an external library LGoodDatePicker to display calendar and time picker.

2)SQL_Database folder has the sql file with queries used in MySQL.
